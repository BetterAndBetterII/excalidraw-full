# Exalidraw Backend

Frustrated on how difficult it is to setup excalidraw self-hosted but with data
storage and collaboration function this represents and attempt to run the
necessary function with a single binary implemented in go.

Apply the patch to the frontend and build excalidraw. Run Excalidraw frontend and
on the same host run
```bash
go run main.go
```
